# DNA_Project

* Created A Mini-world Similar to RedBus
* A mini-world is a set of users and how they will use the database you designâ€”for example, a school examination
system used by students, teachers, and more.
* Phase1 is just an outline for the Project
* Phase2 is drawing ER Diagrams for our Mini-world. ( Can draw using creately,draw.io ) 
* Phase3 is converting the ER Diagram into a Relational Model. And then Converting into First, Second anf Third Normal Forms.
* Phase4 is about creating and populating the database as per the relational schema in MySQL. Also building a command line interface in Python3 to satisfy the functional requirements.



### There are two parts to this project:
 - Creating the database and defining all tables, and loading it with relevant data
 - Performing queries on the database: at least 5 queries & 3 updates (all functional requirements to be
satisfied too)

### The first part can be done purely using the MySQL CLI. For the second part, to create a Python script that can connect to the database using MySQL. In other words, we wrote SQL queries to satisfy each of the functional requirements.
* Also attached a video featuring all the procedure of our work. (creating database,...)
